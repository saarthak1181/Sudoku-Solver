Sudoku Solver Application

This project is a Sudoku Solver built using React. It implements a backtracking algorithm to fill in the Sudoku grid and find the solution for any given valid Sudoku puzzle.

Features

Interactive Interface: Input your Sudoku puzzle directly into the grid.

Solve Button: Automatically solves the puzzle using the backtracking algorithm.

Reset Functionality: Clear the grid and input a new puzzle.

Validation: Ensures the input puzzle adheres to Sudoku rules before solving.

Technologies Used

Frontend: React (JavaScript)

Algorithm: Backtracking for solving the puzzle

How It Works

The user inputs the puzzle into a 9x9 grid.

Upon clicking the "Solve" button, the application uses the backtracking algorithm to find a valid solution.

The solution is displayed in the grid.
